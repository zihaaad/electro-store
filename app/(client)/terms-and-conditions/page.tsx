            Electro operates as a reseller business. We do not manufacture our
            own products but instead sell products from various brands and
            manufacturers. We carefully select quality products from reputable
            brands to offer to our customers.

            manufacturers, and then sell these products to you, our customers.
            We are not affiliated with or endorsed by the manufacturers of the
            products we sell, except where explicitly stated.
